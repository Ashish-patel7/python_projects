# A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
# It is used to store and manipulate data in a program.

name = "Ashish" # String variable
age = 21 # Integer variables
price = 25.99 #Float variable
age1 = age
print(name) # print: Ashish
print(age)  # print: 21
print(price) # print: 25.99

 Variable naming rules or rules for Identifiers
  1.Identifiers can be  combination of uppercse and lowercase letters,digits or an underscore(_).
     so myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
  2.An Identifier can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.
  3. We can't use specialsymbols like !, #, @, %, $, etc in our identifier.
  4.Identifier can be of any length.
  5. Identifiers are cse-sensitive in python. so myVariable and myvariable are two different identifiers.
  6. We can not use python keyword as an identifier. Keywords are reserved words in python that have special meaning.
      Some exmples of keywords are: if , else, while, for, def, return, import,as, in, is, not, and, or, etc.
  7.It is a good practice to use meaningful anmes for variables so taht the code is more readble and understandable.
